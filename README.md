## Business Problem and how we plan to solve it
Microsoft is starting their own movie studio and needs recommendations on what is currently doing well in the movie market. 
We are going to look at datasets and API’s from the biggest movie websites to gather current data, details and technical specs. 

## Where did we get our data?
Data sets from:
IMDB
TMDB

API’s:
IMDb API by apidojo found on Rapid API
GeoCoding API by Google Cloud API

The data we used was filtered by movies that only had a USA release. Foreign movies were included as long as they were still released in America. 

Data sets were filtered to only the last 5 years to get a current representation of what customers want.

# Findings
We compared runtime to ratings scores and the amount of ratings. We wanted to see if the length of the movie had any effect on how it was liked and how many people not only watched but voted on it.
Through our analysis we were able to show that movies that were between 150 to 175 minutes had high scores that had above average amount of votes. Showing that these were good movies seen by a large audience
